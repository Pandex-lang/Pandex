# Why Pandex
When I think to Yandex I understand that it's stand for "Yet Another INDEXer"
and before it, the Pandex name was index But I like my name ( first name ) ,
so my language name should starts with the letter that my first name starts
with this letter and it's short for "Pooia Index".
But I can point to following causes.
* if you call epidemic instead Pandex , it's cause it that Pandex created a year after COVID-19 VIRUS epidemic
* Englishes , Russians and Persians can say Pandex correctly
* Pandex can write beautiful in cyrillic < пандекс >
